## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a data engineer specializing in building scalable data warehousing and analytics solutions using Google BigQuery. This repository contains a collection of projects, templates, and best practices focused on writing efficient SQL queries, designing data pipelines, and integrating BigQuery with other Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services for end-to-end data solutions.

BigQuery offers a powerful, serverless platform for analyzing massive datasets using standard SQL. I use it to develop reliable and cost-effective data workflows that support business intelligence, reporting, and advanced analytics across various domains.

SQL for Analytics: Each project showcases advanced SQL techniques for data transformation, window functions, common table expressions (CTEs), partitioning, and clustering. Youâ€™ll also find reusable query patterns for time-series analysis, KPI tracking, and aggregation strategies tailored for large-scale datasets.

Data Pipelines: This repository features end-to-end pipeline implementations using Cloud Dataflow, Cloud Composer (Airflow), and Cloud Functions to ingest, process, and load data into BigQuery. The pipelines are built with reliability, scalability, and cost-efficiency in mindâ€”leveraging streaming and batch processing depending on use case needs.

GCP Integration: Seamless integration is key to unlocking the full potential of BigQuery. These projects demonstrate how to connect BigQuery with Cloud Storage, Pub/Sub, Looker Studio, and other GCP services to enable real-time ingestion, dashboarding, and event-driven analytics workflows.

This repository is ideal for data engineers, analysts, and architects looking to build modern, cloud-native data solutions. Each project includes well-documented SQL scripts, deployment instructions, and architectural insights to support both experimentation and production use.

Feel free to explore, fork, or contributeâ€”building smart, scalable data systems starts here.
